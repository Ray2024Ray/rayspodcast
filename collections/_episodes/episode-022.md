title: "Episode 022 Art Without Borders: Samira's Creative Path from Tehran to Stanford (English)"
description: '<p>Samira, an Iranian girl born in Tehran, was initially eager to pursue physics and maths, but after seeing historical artworks, she shifted her focus to art. This change in direction, especially choosing the path of pursuing art, was a shock for her family, who were mostly in managerial, engineering, and medical professions. Now an accomplished artist who made her first movie at age 19, Samira explains that art begins by creating something for yourself, and then for your audience. She believes that if you connect with yourself, you turn your creativity on, meaning everybody can be an artist. She also shares that through travel and observation, she began to omit borders in her artwork, focusing on universal connections. She remains active by volunteering in the different communities in Stanford and is focused on studying and preparing to apply for business school.'
