excerpt: "This is Episode 18, the English version of Episode 17, which was originally recorded in Chinese. In this episode, you’ll hear the story of our guest, Alan, presented in a different way. The English audio was generated using AI tools based on the original transcript, so it offers another way to experience his journey. He dreams of building a library, a museum, and a football field for Laosi Village in Hainan. To make this a reality, Village Chief Alan uses the Stanford campus as his classroom, life in the Bay Area as his real-world training, and retired U.S. experts as his advisors. Join his journey to discover how a Chinese village is building a sustainable future through global connections."
