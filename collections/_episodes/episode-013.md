description: '<p>This episode features Yu''En, a scholar from Taiwan currently working
  as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford. </p><p><br /></p><p>His life trajectory has
  involved multiple migrations, starting from Taipei to Central Taiwan and back to
  Taipei, and now includes his endeavors in the US Bay Area. Yu''En defines the concept
  of &quot;homeland&quot; as being closely related to &quot;growth&quot;. He is currently
  striving to make this foreign land &quot;the homeland of tomorrow&quot;.</p><p><br
  /></p><p>Following an early family change and relocation, he moved to live in a
  temple in Central Taiwan for six years. This unique experience was crucial to the
  development of his personality. Yu''En now considers his father''s decision at the
  time to be &quot;wise&quot;, as his father chose to prioritize mental health and
  prevented the family from &quot;falling apart&quot;. During his life at the temple,
  Yu''En learned how to deal with worries and anxieties and developed &quot;awareness&quot;,
  which laid the cornerstone for achieving inner peace.</p><p>Now in the US, in addition
  to conducting pathological research on Parkinson''s disease, he has adapted to the
  academic environment by working with a US supervisor. Furthermore, he and his wife
  Suki(Episode 003/004) cultivated a deep &quot;revolutionary bond&quot; during their
  life abroad.</p><p>Join us as we follow Yu''En''s journey, exploring how he gradually
  reconstructed his self and defined a new place of belonging through multiple migrations.</p><p>Duration:
  55 min</p><p><br /></p><p>本期节目邀请到来自台湾、现于斯坦福担任博士后研究员的Yu''En。他的人生轨迹经历了从台北到中部、再重返台北，直至今日在美国湾区打拼的多重迁徙。Yu''En对故乡的定义与“成长”紧密相关，他正努力将现今的异乡生活“活成他日的故乡”。
  在早年因家庭变故搬迁后，他曾在台湾中部的寺庙生活了六年，这段独特的经历对他的人格养成至关重要。现在的Yu''En认为父亲当时做了一个明智的决定，因为他选择了优先支持心理健康，避免了家庭的&quot;分崩离析&quot;。在这段寺庙生活期间，Yu''En学会了如何处理烦恼与焦虑，并学会了「觉察」，这些经历都为他奠定了通往内心平静的基石。
  如今在美国，他除了进行帕金森氏症的病理学研究，也在学术环境中，适应了与一位每日追问进度的美国老板相处，并成功争取到独立自主的研究训练模式。此外，他与妻子 Suki
  在异国生活中培养了深厚的革命情感，并且领悟到了亲密关系中的真谛。 请加入我，一起跟随Yu''En的脚步，探索他在多地迁徙中，如何一步步重塑自我、定义新的归属地。
