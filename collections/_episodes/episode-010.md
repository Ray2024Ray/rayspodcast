description: <p>Welcome to Episodes 9 (Chinese) and 10 (English)! I am deeply honored
  to host my friend, Niya. This also marks my first attempt at recording online. Although
  separated by the Pacific Ocean, our conversation still reached the depths of our
  hearts.Where I am deeply honored to host my friend, Niya. This also marks my first
  attempt at recording online. Although separated by the Pacific Ocean, our conversation
  still reached the depths of our hearts.</p><p>We met and became acquainted while
  doing volunteering at the Stanford International Center. Niya lived in California
  for a year as a <strong>Berkeley Visiting Scholar</strong>, while also being a <strong>Stanford
  Scholar's Family Member</strong> and actively participating in many Stanford campus
  activities. She returned to China this February and currently works in Beijing at
  an educational research institution, studying education finance and policy formulation.</p><p>I
  was thrilled to talk with Niya about her unique observations and interpretations
  of &quot;abroad&quot; and &quot;home.&quot; In this episode, she shared her understanding
  of <em>hometown</em>, noting that it is separated into geographical and psychological
  aspects. She referenced the profound idea that <strong>“Hometown is where the heart
  finds peace”</strong>. She also sincerely discussed her psychological transformation,
  moving from the highly pressurized domestic state (known as &quot;involution&quot;)
  to a more <strong>relaxed</strong> and self-enjoying state.</p><p>Niya also generously
  shared her experience of parenting abroad, detailing how her son, Phil, adapted
  to the relaxed educational environment of the American public school system, and
  her redefinition of <em>family</em>—focusing on her own nuclear family. We hope
  that through Niya's story, everyone can feel that open, free, and self-pleasing
  attitude toward life, and find spiritual belonging (a home for the soul).</p><p><strong>P.S.:</strong> </p><p>During
  the recording of this episode, I was so focused on being the host that I held back
  my emotions. However, when editing the program, I was moved a second time; I cried
  while editing and felt healed in the process. I sincerely hope this episode brings
  some emotional resonance to you on the other end of your phone. If you enjoy this
