description: '<p>In Episode 11, we have the very <strong>first male guest</strong> I''ve
  interviewed since starting the podcast, Brian!</p><p>Brian is my fellow Hénán native.
  Although we haven''t reached the point of &quot;seeing a fellow villager in a foreign
  land brings tears to the eyes,&quot; meeting him still felt exceptionally warm.</p><p>Brian
  and I have known each other for over a year. Last summer, he and his wife moved
  from Texas to California, where he accompanied his wife during her post-doc while
  looking for a job himself.</p><p>This year, he finally successfully secured a software
  engineer position, officially joining the ranks of Silicon Valley programmers. In
  this episode, I heard this sentiment from Brian''s sharing: the so-called hometown
  is <strong>childhood</strong>, and the so-called nostalgia is a <strong>pleasant
  melancholy</strong>. Listen to his experiences in different cities, and reflect
  on what he said: <strong>wandering does not mean you are a stranger in a foreign
  land</strong>; it can also be viewed as an opportunity to <strong>explore life experiences</strong>.
  Perhaps you will come to love the current version of yourself who chose a different
  path.</p><p>Length: 55 min</p><p>这一期的嘉宾是我播客开录以来采访到的<strong>第一位男嘉宾</strong>，Brian！（欢呼声）</p><p>Brian
  是我的河南老乡，虽然没有到“异国见老乡，两眼泪汪汪”的程度，但见到还是会觉得格外亲切。</p><p>我和 Brian 认识也有一年多了。去年夏天，他和太太从美国德州搬到加州，一边陪太太做博后，一边自己找工作。</p><p>今年，他终于成功拿到软件工程师的职位，正式加入了硅谷码农的行列。这一期，我从Brian的分享里听到了这样的感触：所谓故乡就是童年，所谓乡愁就是一种愉悦的忧伤。听一听他在不同城市的经历，想一想他说的，漂泊并不代表你就是异客，也可以是你对自己生命的一种探索。也许你会更加喜欢当下选择了不一样道路的自己。</p><p>时长：55分钟</p>'
