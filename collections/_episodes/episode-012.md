  hope you find this episode interesting!</p><p>In this episode of <em>Cross-Cultural
  Stories</em>, I’m joined by my first male guest, Brian, who, like me, is from Henan.
  His journey has taken him from Zhengzhou to Beijing, Shanghai, Texas, and now California.
  Along the way, he reflects on how moving between cities and cultures shaped his
  outlook—from the ambition of his 20s to the simplicity he values in his 30s. For
  Brian, “homesickness is really about longing for childhood,” a thought that resonates
  deeply. We also discussed the warmth of neighbors in Texas, the fast-paced life
  in California, the contrasts between AI and human experience, and the mindset of
  living abroad. Brian’s story is a reminder that migration is not only about geography—it’s
  about discovering ourselves and the meaning we bring to life.</p>
