description: <p>Welcome to Episodes 9 (Chinese) and 10 (English)! I am deeply honored
  to host my friend, Niya. This also marks my first attempt at recording online. Although
  separated by the Pacific Ocean, our conversation still reached the depths of our
  hearts.</p><p>We met and became acquainted while doing volunteering at the Stanford
  International Center. Niya lived in California for a year as a <strong>Berkeley
  Visiting Scholar</strong>, while also being a <strong>Stanford Scholar's Family
  Member</strong> and actively participating in many Stanford campus activities. She
  returned to China this February and currently works in Beijing at an educational
  research institution, studying education finance and policy formulation.</p><p>I
  was thrilled to talk with Niya about her unique observations and interpretations
  of "abroad" and "home." In this episode, she shared her understanding of <em>hometown</em>,
  noting that it is separated into geographical and psychological aspects. She referenced
  the profound idea that <strong>“Hometown is where the heart finds peace”</strong>.
  She also sincerely discussed her psychological transformation, moving from the highly
  pressurized domestic state (known as "involution") to a more <strong>relaxed</strong> and
  self-enjoying state.</p><p>Niya also generously shared her experience of parenting
  abroad, detailing how her son, Phil, adapted to the relaxed educational environment
  of the American public school system, and her redefinition of <em>family</em>—focusing
  on her own nuclear family. We hope that through Niya's story, everyone can feel
  that open, free, and self-pleasing attitude toward life, and find spiritual belonging
  (a home for the soul).</p><p><strong>P.S.:</strong> During the recording of this
  episode, I was so focused on being the host that I held back my emotions. However,
  when editing the program, I was moved a second time; I cried while editing and felt
  healed in the process. I sincerely hope this episode brings some emotional resonance
  to you on the other end of your phone. </p><p>If you enjoy this podcast, please
