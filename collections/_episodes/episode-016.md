description: '<p>In this special episode, the tables are turned as podcast host Ray,
  me, becomes the interviewee. Gently guided by Stanford volunteer Brad''s insightful
  questions, I open up about my journey across three cultures: China, South Korea,
  and the United States. I share my upbringing in China''s Henan province, how living
  in Korea helped me find a self that felt &quot;seen,&quot; and my navigation between
  career and passion as a research professional. I delve into why living abroad strengthened
  my connection to my Chinese roots and what ultimately inspired me to create a podcast
  dedicated to capturing cross-cultural stories. This is more than a personal narrative;
  it''s a genuine conversation about identity, belonging, and the pivotal turns in
  life''s path. I hope this episode could resonate you whoever you are. </p>'
