title: "Episode 023 When I Was an Editor in Korea (Part 1): Soy-Marinated Crab, Typhoons, and the Many Ways to Live Across Cultures (Chinese)"
description: '<p>As President Lee Jae-myung of South Korea visits China, Chinese-Korean relations have once again become a hot topic. At this moment, my friend from my time studying in Korea and I would rather talk about the specific people and concrete experiences. In this episode of the podcast, we are honored to invite PD Wanzi, the former Chinese-language editor-in-chief of the benchmark cultural magazine Jeju Weekly in Jeju Island. We ask her to share her genuine experiences as a young Chinese person in Korea from three dimensions: student life, workplace culture, and media observations.'
