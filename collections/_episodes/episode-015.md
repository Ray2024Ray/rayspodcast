description: '<p>In this episode, our guest Brad shares his journey as a long-term
  volunteer at CCIS in Stanford’s Bechtel International Center.</p><p>Together, we
  explored:</p><ul><li>Where does our sense of insecurity in a new environment come
  from?</li><li>How is a genuine connection like a “dance for two”?</li><li>And why
  can an open community ease both the confusion of the young and the loneliness of
  the elderly?</li></ul><p>Listen as Brad reflects on more than ten years of volunteering:
  years filled with countless touching life stories, all unfolding within one small
  yet remarkable community.</p><p><strong>CCIS:</strong> (<a href="https://ccisstanfordu.org/"
