description: '<p><strong>Episode 002 Finding Yourself Among Cultures — A Conversation
  with Kate</strong></p><p><strong>Duration</strong>: ~35 min</p><p>Welcome to <em>Multi-Cultural
  Stories</em> — a podcast where we explore identity, transformation, and belonging
  through cross-cultural experiences.</p><p>In this very first English-language episode,
  I’m honored to sit down with <strong>Kate</strong>, one of the very first people
  I met after arriving at Stanford. Her encouragement and belief in this idea gave
  me the push I needed to launch this podcast.</p><p>Kate was born in <strong>Belarus</strong>,
  speaks multiple languages, and has lived and worked in <strong>three different countries</strong>.
  Her story is a powerful one — from navigating identity across cultures to making
  bold career transitions, and ultimately finding her passion in helping others do
  the same.</p><p>Today, Kate serves as the program coordinator at Stanford’s Bechtel
  International Center, where she supports international scholars and their families
  — including me. She’s also the founder of <a href="https://www.careerpathway.info/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20608344173&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAqDOY1NgzAGvHQTxR3dRiVk57BJgg&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwy7HEBhBJEiwA5hQNoiyeUgIjieTLxQ8Xmtg0KjnPO0-7fTTGxSwHXnrYTRzXtfrrGOkHSBoCQeUQAvD_BwE"
  rel="ugc noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Career Pathway Institute</strong></a>,
  a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping immigrants and international professionals
  find their place in the U.S. job market.</p><p>In our conversation, we begin with
  the idea of <em>“home”</em>, and follow the thread through her personal and professional
  journey — the confusion, the courage, and the clarity that comes from embracing
  change.</p><p>If you’re navigating the uncertainty of starting a new career in a
  new country, this episode will resonate deeply and offer both insight and encouragement.</p><p>Let’s
  dive in.</p><p><br /></p>'
