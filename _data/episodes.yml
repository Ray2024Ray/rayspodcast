    as a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford. </p><p><br /></p><p>His life trajectory
    has involved multiple migrations, starting from Taipei to Central Taiwan and back
    to Taipei, and now includes his endeavors in the US Bay Area. Yu''En defines the
    concept of &quot;homeland&quot; as being closely related to &quot;growth&quot;.
    He is currently striving to make this foreign land &quot;the homeland of tomorrow&quot;.</p><p><br
    /></p><p>Following an early family change and relocation, he moved to live in
    a temple in Central Taiwan for six years. This unique experience was crucial to
    the development of his personality. Yu''En now considers his father''s decision
    at the time to be &quot;wise&quot;, as his father chose to prioritize mental health and
    prevented the family from &quot;falling apart&quot;. During his life at the temple,
    Yu''En learned how to deal with worries and anxieties and developed &quot;awareness&quot;,
    which laid the cornerstone for achieving inner peace.</p><p>Now in the US, in
    addition to conducting pathological research on Parkinson''s disease, he has adapted
    to the academic environment by working with a US supervisor. Furthermore, he and
    his wife Suki(Episode 003/004) cultivated a deep &quot;revolutionary bond&quot; during
    their life abroad.</p><p>Join us as we follow Yu''En''s journey, exploring how
    he gradually reconstructed his self and defined a new place of belonging through
    multiple migrations.</p><p>Duration: 55 min</p><p><br /></p><p>本期节目邀请到来自台湾、现于斯坦福担任博士后研究员的Yu''En。他的人生轨迹经历了从台北到中部、再重返台北，直至今日在美国湾区打拼的多重迁徙。Yu''En对故乡的定义与“成长”紧密相关，他正努力将现今的异乡生活“活成他日的故乡”。
    在早年因家庭变故搬迁后，他曾在台湾中部的寺庙生活了六年，这段独特的经历对他的人格养成至关重要。现在的Yu''En认为父亲当时做了一个明智的决定，因为他选择了优先支持心理健康，避免了家庭的&quot;分崩离析&quot;。在这段寺庙生活期间，Yu''En学会了如何处理烦恼与焦虑，并学会了「觉察」，这些经历都为他奠定了通往内心平静的基石。
    如今在美国，他除了进行帕金森氏症的病理学研究，也在学术环境中，适应了与一位每日追问进度的美国老板相处，并成功争取到独立自主的研究训练模式。此外，他与妻子 Suki
    在异国生活中培养了深厚的革命情感，并且领悟到了亲密关系中的真谛。 请加入我，一起跟随Yu''En的脚步，探索他在多地迁徙中，如何一步步重塑自我、定义新的归属地。

    I hope you find this episode interesting!</p><p>In this episode of <em>Cross-Cultural
    Stories</em>, I’m joined by my first male guest, Brian, who, like me, is from
    Henan. His journey has taken him from Zhengzhou to Beijing, Shanghai, Texas, and
    now California. Along the way, he reflects on how moving between cities and cultures
    shaped his outlook—from the ambition of his 20s to the simplicity he values in
    his 30s. For Brian, “homesickness is really about longing for childhood,” a thought
    that resonates deeply. We also discussed the warmth of neighbors in Texas, the
    fast-paced life in California, the contrasts between AI and human experience,
    and the mindset of living abroad. Brian’s story is a reminder that migration is
    not only about geography—it’s about discovering ourselves and the meaning we bring
    to life.</p>

    interviewed since starting the podcast, Brian!</p><p>Brian is my fellow Hénán
    native. Although we haven''t reached the point of &quot;seeing a fellow villager
    in a foreign land brings tears to the eyes,&quot; meeting him still felt exceptionally
    warm.</p><p>Brian and I have known each other for over a year. Last summer, he
    and his wife moved from Texas to California, where he accompanied his wife during
    her post-doc while looking for a job himself.</p><p>This year, he finally successfully
    secured a software engineer position, officially joining the ranks of Silicon
    Valley programmers. In this episode, I heard this sentiment from Brian''s sharing:
    the so-called hometown is <strong>childhood</strong>, and the so-called nostalgia
    is a <strong>pleasant melancholy</strong>. Listen to his experiences in different
    cities, and reflect on what he said: <strong>wandering does not mean you are a
    stranger in a foreign land</strong>; it can also be viewed as an opportunity to <strong>explore
    life experiences</strong>. Perhaps you will come to love the current version of
    yourself who chose a different path.</p><p>Length: 55 min</p><p>这一期的嘉宾是我播客开录以来采访到的<strong>第一位男嘉宾</strong>，Brian！（欢呼声）</p><p>Brian
    是我的河南老乡，虽然没有到“异国见老乡，两眼泪汪汪”的程度，但见到还是会觉得格外亲切。</p><p>我和 Brian 认识也有一年多了。去年夏天，他和太太从美国德州搬到加州，一边陪太太做博后，一边自己找工作。</p><p>今年，他终于成功拿到软件工程师的职位，正式加入了硅谷码农的行列。这一期，我从Brian的分享里听到了这样的感触：所谓故乡就是童年，所谓乡愁就是一种愉悦的忧伤。听一听他在不同城市的经历，想一想他说的，漂泊并不代表你就是异客，也可以是你对自己生命的一种探索。也许你会更加喜欢当下选择了不一样道路的自己。</p><p>时长：55分钟</p>'

  description: <p>This Episode is in Korean.</p><p>Welcome to <strong>Cross-cultural
    Stories</strong>, the podcast that shares tales of emotions, changes, confusion,
    and growth that we experience when living away from our hometowns. This podcast
    aims to offer comfort and a sense of shared understanding for listeners, and for
    me and others navigating multicultural lives, it's a journey of self-reflection
    and healing.</p><p>In this special two-part series, we delve into a profound conversation
    with my friend of nearly ten years, Ara, who is currently a post doctoral researcher
    in Stanford. Ara's life has been a continuous journey through different "foreign
    lands" since her childhood, taking her from her hometown to Seoul, Pohang, in
    South Korea, and now, California in the United States.</p><p>In Part 2, our conversation
    deepens as Ara shares how her time in America has profoundly fostered self-understanding
    and a re-evaluation of her life experiences. We discuss the unexpected perspectives
    gained on privilege, the illusion of "amazing people," and the importance of embracing
    individuality and diverse social groups. Ara highlights how the American approach
    to failure as a natural part of the journey has liberated her from the intense
    self-judgment often felt in Korea. She reflects on the joy of pursuing one's passions
    and the personal growth that comes from constantly moving and adapting. This candid
    discussion culminates in Ara’s updated outlook, as she considers returning to
    Korea with a newfound strength and understanding, ready to embrace its good aspects
    and navigate its challenges.</p><p>Join us for this insightful and deeply personal
    two-episode journey as we explore how life in a foreign land truly changes us,
    shapes our identities, and ultimately, helps us understand ourselves better.</p><p><br

    이르기까지 끊임없이 다양한 '낯선 땅'을 여행해온 여정이었습니다.</p><p><strong>2부에서는</strong> 아라가 미국에서의 시간이
    어떻게 <strong>자기 이해와 삶의 경험에 대한 재평가</strong>를 깊이 있게 촉진했는지 공유하며 대화가 깊어집니다. 우리는 특권에
    대한 예상치 못한 통찰, '놀라운 사람들'이라는 환상, 그리고 <strong>개성과 다양한 사회적 집단을 포용하는 것</strong>의 중요성에
    대해 논의합니다. 아라는 <strong>실패를 여정의 자연스러운 일부</strong>로 받아들이는 미국식 접근이 한국에서 자주 느끼던 강렬한
    자기 비판으로부터 그녀를 해방시켰다고 강조합니다. 그녀는 자신의 열정을 추구하는 기쁨과 끊임없이 움직이고 적응하며 얻는 개인적 성장에 대해
    성찰합니다. 이 솔직한 대화는 아라가 새롭게 얻은 힘과 이해를 바탕으로 한국으로 돌아가 그 좋은 점을 받아들이고 어려움을 헤쳐 나갈 준비가
    되었다는 업데이트된 관점으로 마무리됩니다.</p><p><br /></p><p>외국에서의 삶이 우리를 어떻게 진정으로 변화시키고, 정체성을 형성하며,
    궁극적으로 자신을 더 잘 이해하도록 돕는지 탐구하는 이 통찰력 넘치고 깊이 있는 두 편의 여정에 함께해주시면 좋겠어요.</p>

    a "foreign land" not just by physical distance, but by the <strong>emotional connections

    and parenting;and from California’s openness and respect toward gender identity

    find inspiration in these stories to better understand cultures beyond your own,

    researcher at Stanford University, she is an active and vibrant presence on campus—participating

    positive energy to those around her.</p><p>In this episode (Part 1), we talk about
    the turning point when her thriving career came to a sudden pause, and how she
    navigated the emotional journey of rediscovering her self-worth. She shares her
    heartfelt reflections after listening to the first few episodes of this podcast—and
    how certain stories resonated deeply with her own experiences.</p><p>We also explore

    to the ER in the U.S.—a story that blends surprise, helplessness, and unexpectedly
    heartwarming moments.</p><p>Whether or not you’ve lived abroad yourself, this
    conversation feels like a letter sent across borders—about courage, adaptation,
    and the warmth of human connection.</p><p>Suki 来自台湾，曾是一名拥有多年经验的营养师，专业与温暖兼具。如今，她以斯坦福大学博后家属的身份生活在校园中，不仅积极参加各类活动，还热心投身志愿服务，是社区里总能带来正能量的人。</p><p>在这期节目（上集）中，我们一起走进她从成熟的职场到职涯中断的转折时刻，听她分享那段重新寻找自我价值的心理旅程；她也谈到听完本播客前几期后的真情感受。</p><p>我们还聊到她初到美国面对的文化冲击与适应过程，从日常小事到深层观念的变化；以及一次难忘的美国急诊经历——那是一段夹杂着惊讶、无助和暖心瞬间的故事，让人忍不住会心一笑，也引人深思。</p><p>无论你是否身处异乡，这期节目都像一封跨越国界的信，关于勇气、适应、人与人之间的温暖链接。希望这期节目能够成为你的陪伴。</p><p>时长：25
